# Step 0: Grantee metadata

We began by preparing grantee metadata to be used in all subsequent steps. We took as our input a structured list of ERA1 and ERA2 grantees compiled by the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC).

We also generated geographic crosswalks between grantees and Census geographies, as well as between city-level grantees and county-level grantees.
