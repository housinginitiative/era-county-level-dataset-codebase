# Thresholding descriptives

The CSV files included in this directory are the output of [Step 6: Thresholding](https://github.com/housinginitiative/era-county-level-dataset-codebase/tree/main/current_codebase/6_thresholding). More details on the thresholding criteria may be found in the readme of the linked directory above. More details on the accompanying data quality metrics may be found in the [`validation_metrics`](https://github.com/housinginitiative/era-county-level-dataset-codebase/tree/main/outputs/validation_metrics) directory.

The images found under `grantee_thresholding_flowcharts` illustrate the extent of the data falling out at each thresholding step.
